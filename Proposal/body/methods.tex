We split this section into four parts: \textbf{Data, Preprocessing, Data Augmentation} and \textbf{Model}.
\subsection{Data}
We used \textbf{ESC-50} dataset that is most commonly used in environmental sounds classification. The dataset consists of 5-second-long audio segment which can be classified into one of 50 sound events, e.g., dog barks, sea waves sound, rain sound.
The 50 sound event class could loosely arranged into 5 major categories: \textbf{Animals, Natural Soundscapes \& Water Sound, Human(Non-Speech Sounds), }and \textbf{Exterior/Urban Noises}. Each categories include 10 class.
The dataset included 2000 environmental audio sample(with 40 example per class).
